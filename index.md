- Select some text
- Open context menu and click "copy link .... to selected text" 
  + `tip: use `<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>` to copy text fragment`
- Click the extension toolbar icon to open the popup
  + `tip: use `<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd>` to copy text fragment`
- Click the "paste" button the text fragment link into the popup to generate a QR code.
- You can now share the link you copied or scan the QR code to see the relevant text highlighted.

When someone scans that QR or just goes to the link you copied, A feature called Scroll to text fragment allows the text fragment to be detected when they load the webpage, and will scroll your selected text into view and be highlighted in yellow üü®.

Currently scanning the QR code to see the highlights will only work Android.

### [](#what-are-text-fragments)**What are Text Fragments?**

**‚Ñπ[Text Fragments](https://wicg.github.io/scroll-to-text-fragment/)**: Part of a URL that specifies a piece of text emphasized on page load and scrolled into view, not unlike a text anchor.

> "Text Fragments adds support for specifying a text snippet in the URL fragment. When navigating to a URL with such a fragment, the user agent can quickly emphasise and/or bring it to the user‚Äôs attention."<a href="#ref_frag"><sup>1</sup></a>


##### Syntax of Text Fragment URL
   
Syntax: `https://foo.bar/#:~:text=yoursnippet`

The text fragment can be specified in the fragment directive, which will always be after in the [URL fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment) of the URL, after `#`(there may be a word after the `#` but before `:~:`, and that would be another kind of fragment, but it's all good). The fragment directive delimiter is the following string: `:~:`. You can specify `text=yoursnippet` after it and in chromium browsers, and some other browsers, `yoursnippet` will be scrolled into view and highlighted, when opened.

##### Example

Consider the following URL:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability\_distribution#cite_ref-:1_3-0__:~:textStart=Examples of random phenomena include the weather condition in a future date__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution#cite_ref-:1_3-0:~:text=Examples%20of%20random%20phenomena%20include%20the%20weather%20condition%20in%20a%20future%20date)

If we take our previous url(`https://foo.bar/#:~:text=yourtext`) and map it out to this URL, we would get:
 1. `foo.bar` > `en/wikipedia.org`
 2. `#` > `#cite_ref-:1_3-0`
 3. `yoursnippet` > `Examples of random phenomena include the weather condition in a future date`


**Update on text fragments:** In Chrome 87, there is a new flag in chrome://flags that adds "copy link to text" to the context menu on Android and Desktop. However in the latest version of chrome as of November 23, 2020, it does not work.

***Update Dec 2020:*** Chrome 88(beta) by default has the copy link to text item in the context menu and it is functional. Hopefully if it get's carried to the stable version and get more documentation and an API.



### [](#what-browsers-and-oss-see-the-text-highlighted-in-yellow-when-they-scan-the-qr-code-or-open-the-link)**What browsers and Operating Systems see the text fragments highlighted in yellow when they scan the QR code or open the link?**


Since the QR code contains the text fragment link, the QR code and the link are the same. The yellow highlight comes from the **Scroll to text fragment** feature, so the question is:

> *Which browsers and OSs support Scroll to text fragment or a feature similar to it?*

Scroll to text fragment is a feature in Chromium\-based browsers[\[2\]](#ref2) . There may be similar features in other browsers.

Mobile operating systems(I need to recheck these, so they may be out of date)

1.  **Android works**(check browsers below)
2.  **iOS doesn't work(yet)**  
3.  **IPadOS to be determined**

All other devices(using the text fragment URL) 4. Pretty much the same browsers work on Mac, Windows, and Linux but still check to make sure whoever you send the link to is running one of the OS/browser combination below.

[Let me know](https://bit.ly/feature_request_form) if you want your operating system or browser to appear in the table below.

| Operating System | Browser Version |
| --- | --- |
| Android | Chrome 85, Android WebView 81, Samsung Internet latest.(could be more) |
| Windows | Microsoft Edge 83, Chrome 80, Opera 68 |
| Linux | Microsoft Edge 83, Chrome 80, Opera 68 |
| Mac OS X | Microsoft Edge 83, Chrome 80, Opera 68 |
| iOS | N/A. Could come in early 2021. |

Remember, Fragment is also a functional QR code generator, so even if you cannot use text fragments, you can skip to step 3 of the instructions steps
