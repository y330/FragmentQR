**FragmentQR is a Chrome extension that simplifies linking to certain text on a webpage by letting you select text and copy it as a text fragment to generate a QR code for it, that will highlight the text in yellow when scanned. [Like this](https://example.com/#:~:text=use%20in%20illustrative%20examples%20in%20documents.%20You%20may%20use%20this%20domain%20in%20literature%20without)**





### What does FragmentQR do?

FragmentQR adds a an option to the context menu to copy a text fragment when selecting text, and enables generating a QR code for the text fragment in an extension popup by clicking the FragmentQR toolbar button.
 To make the process easier, I added keyboard shortcuts:

```Ctrl/‚åò + ‚áß + L``` to copy the text fragment to your clipboard,  ```Ctrl/‚åò + Q``` to open the extension popup, and a ```üìã```(Paste) button in the popup to paste the text fragment link into the popup to generate a QR code. 

When someone scans that QR or just goes to the link you copied, A feature called Scroll to text fragment allows the text fragment to be detected when they load the webpage, and will scroll your selected text into view and be highlighted in yellowüü®.

Currently scanning the QR code to see the highlights will only work Android.

### Other Features

+ Automatically Generate QR for current tab when opening extension popup
+ text box to edit QR code
+ Paste, copy and clear buttons
+ Light and dark themes
+ Popup can be made larger
+ Button to download QR as png
+ Material design

***Update on text fragments:** In Chrome 87, there is a new flag in chrome://flags that adds "copy link to text" to the context menu on Android and Desktop. However in the latest version of chrome as of November 23, 2020, it does not work.

### **What are Text Fragments?** 

**[Text Fragments](https://wicg.github.io/scroll-to-text-fragment/)**: Part of a URL that specifies a piece of text emphasized on page load and scrolled into view, not unlike a text anchor. 


>    "Text Fragments adds support for specifying a text snippet in the URL fragment. When navigating to a URL with such a fragment, the user agent can quickly emphasise and/or bring it to the user‚Äôs attention."<sup>[[1]](#ref_frag)</sup>


Syntax: ```https://foo.bar/#:~:text=yourtext```

The text fragment can be specified in the fragment directive, which will always be after in the [URL fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment) of the URL, after `#`. The fragment directive delimiter is the following string: ```:~:```. You can specify ```text=yourtext``` after it and in some browsers, such as Google Chrome, ```yourtext``` will be scrolled into view and highlighted, when opened.


Example:

>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution#cite_ref-:1_3-0:~:text=Examples
%20of%20random%20phenomena%20include%20the,
the%20results%20of%20a%20survey%2C%20etc.%5B4%5D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution#cite_ref-:1_3-0:~:text=Examples%20of%20random%20phenomena%20include%20the,the%20results%20of%20a%20survey%2C%20etc.%5B4%5D)

The aforementioned link to [Probability Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) on [Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) will highlight the following text snippet:
> Examples of random phenomena include the weather condition in a future date, the height of a person, the fraction of male students in a school, the results of a survey, etc.[4]


Chromium 80 and above uses text fragments in a feature called <a href="https://github.com/WICG/scroll-to-text-fragment/" title="Scroll-to-Text Fragment on GitHub">Scroll-to-Text Fragment</a>. Text fragments may be owned by W3C or WICG.
